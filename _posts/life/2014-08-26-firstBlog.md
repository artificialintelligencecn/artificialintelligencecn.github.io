### Otc. 2014 Shanghai

1. I graduated from Tsinghua University in 1985. I have spent 2 years as a visitor at MIT from 1986 to 1988.

2. I'm now a associate profeesor in Shanghai Jiaotong University. My major interest is machine learning and its application. I'm also teaching ''statistical learning theory and applications'' from 2012.
